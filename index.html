        <p>I love to code because it is usable art.
Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling. We can create apps, games, websites, animation and lot more.The joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. While constructing the program you constantly expand your understanding of both the problem and the solution. In addition, there is almost no limit to what you can learn to improve your craft â€“ languages, algorithms, tools, frameworks. I can also help people of our nation or the world by creating apps such as a calculator, timer, communicate and also learning.
